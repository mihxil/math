[TIP]
====
Expressions can be typed using the following operators:

[#calculator_operators]
+:: for addition
-:: for subtraction
â‹…:: for multiplication (can be typed by '*')
/:: for division
*:: for the default 'group operation' (type ';'), for many groups this is the same as multiplication

Furthermore, constants of the field are recognized. Like 'pi' or 'i'.

Elements of the field are simply recognized if they are numeric, otherwise they may be quoted. E.g. an element of the complex field may be given as "3+4i". If they are simple strings like 'r3' they can also be matched as a constant of the field.
