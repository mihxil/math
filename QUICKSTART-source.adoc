== statistics

Take dependency on link:https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/org.meeuw/mihxil-time[`org.meeuw:mihxil-time`] and use things like

== date parsing
Take dependency on link:https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/org.meeuw/mihxil-time[`org.meeuw:mihxil-time`] and use

== algebraic structures
A lot of 'algebraic structures' are implemented in link:https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/org.meeuw.math/mihxil-algebra[`org.meeuw.math:mihxil-algebra`].

E.g. if you want to use the quaternions implementation:
