The core of this project is quite abstract and more or less theoretical. But here are some handy things in this.

NOTE: examples in this section use java 25's link:https://openjdk.org/jeps/512[compact source files]

== statistics

Take dependency on link:https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/org.meeuw.math/mihxil-statistics[`org.meeuw.math:mihxil-statistics`] and use things like

[source, java]
----
include::mihxil-demo/src/quickstart/QuickStartWindowed.java[]
----

== date parsing
Take dependency on link:https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/org.meeuw/mihxil-time[`org.meeuw:mihxil-time`] and use

[source, java]
----
include::mihxil-demo/src/quickstart/QuickStartDateParser.java[]
----

== algebraic structures
A lot of 'algebraic structures' are implemented in link:https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/org.meeuw.math/mihxil-algebra[`org.meeuw.math:mihxil-algebra`].

E.g. if you want to use the quaternions implementation:
