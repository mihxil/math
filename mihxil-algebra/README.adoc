This contains various implementations of the algebraic structure interfaces of `mihxil-math`. Like `RationalNumber` (modelling of rational numbers ℚ), and the rotation group SO(3).

== Features
=== Real numbers

The field of real numbers. Backed by java primitive `double`. A `RealNumber` is also 'uncertain', which is used to keep track of rounding errors.

- element  link:{gha}abstractalgebra/reals/RealNumber.java[`RealNumber`]
- structure link:{gha}abstractalgebra/reals/RealField.java[`RealField`]



=== Arbitrary precision real numbers

The field of reals numbers, but backed by java's `BigDecimal`. This means that it supports arbitrary precision, but, since this still
is not _exact_ this still is uncertain, and rounding errors are propagated.

- element link:{gha}abstractalgebra/reals/BigDecimalElement.java[`BigDecimalElement`]
- structure link:{gha}abstractalgebra/reals/BigDecimalField.java[`BigDecimalField`]


=== Rational numbers

The field of rational numbers. Implemented using two arbitrary sized `BigIntegers`.

- element link:{gha}abstractalgebra/rationalnumbers/RationalNumber.java[`RationalNumber`]
- structure link:{gha}abstractalgebra/rationalnumbers/RationalNumbers.java[`RationalNumbers`]

Also, since division is exact in this field, this does _not_ implement `UncertainNumber`.

The cardinality is countable (ℵ~0~) so this _does_ implement `Streamable`.

=== Permutations

The permutation group. An example of a non-abelian finite group.

- element link:{gha}abstractalgebra/permutations/Permutation.java[`Permutation`]
- structure link:{gha}abstractalgebra/permutations/PermutationGroup.java[`PermutationGroup`]

This is group is finite, so streamable. This means that the group also contains an implementation of 'all permutations' (this is non-trivial, it's using Knuth's algorithm).

The permutation elements themselves are implemented as a `java.util.function.UnaryOperator` on `Object[]` which then performs the actual permutation.


=== Integers
The most basic algebraic structure which can be created from integers are the integers (ℤ) themselves. They form a ring:

- element link:{gha}abstractalgebra/integers/IntegerElement.java[`IntegerElement`]
- structure link:{gha}abstractalgebra/integers/Integers.java[`Integers`]


=== Even integers
As an example of a 'rng' (a ring without the existence of the multiplicative identity 1), the even integers can serve

- element link:{gha}abstractalgebra/integers/EvenIntegerElement.java[`EvenIntegerElement`]
- structure link:{gha}abstractalgebra/integers/EvenIntegers.java[`EvenIntegers`]

=== Natural numbers
In the natural numbers ℕ (the non-negative integers), there can be no subtraction. So they only form a 'monoid' (both additive and multiplicative).

- element link:{gha}abstractalgebra/integers/NaturalNumber.java[`NaturalNumber`]
- structure link:{gha}abstractalgebra/integers/NaturalNumbers.java[`NaturalNumbers`]

=== Modulo groups
Integers can be simply restricted via modulo arithmetic to form a finite ring:

- element link:{gha}abstractalgebra/integers/ModuloRingElement.java[`ModuloRingElement`]
- structure link:{gha}abstractalgebra/integers/ModuloRing.java[`ModuloRing`]

If the 'divisor' is a prime, then they even form a field, because the reciprocal can be defined:

- element link:{gha}abstractalgebra/integers/ModuloFieldElement.java[`ModuleFieldElement`]
- structure link:{gha}abstractalgebra/integers/ModuloField.java[`ModuloField`]

=== Complex numbers

Another well-known field is the field of complex numbers.

- element link:{gha}abstractalgebra/complex/ComplexNumber.java[`ComplexNumber`]
- structure link:{gha}abstractalgebra/complex/ComplexNumbers.java[`ComplexNumbers`]

=== Quaternions

Quaternions are forming a 'non-commutative' field, a link:{ghm}abstractalgebra/DivisionRing.java[DivisionRing]

- element link:{gha}abstractalgebra/quaternions/Quaternion.java[`Quaternion`]
- structure link:{gha}abstractalgebra/quaternions/Quaternions.java[`Quaternions`]

=== Matrix and rotation groups

==== SO(3)

Another non-abelian (not-commutative) multiplicative group.

- element link:{gha}abstractalgebra/dim3/Rotation.java[`Rotation`]
- structure link:{gha}abstractalgebra/dim3/RotationGroup.java[`RotationGroup`]

=== Strings

Actually, one of the simplest algebraic object you can think of are the strings. They form an additive monoid, an algebraic structure with only one operation (addition).

- element link:{gha}abstractalgebra/strings/StringElement.java[`StringElement`]
- structure link:{gha}abstractalgebra/strings/StringMonoid.java[`StringMonoid`]

Their cardinality is only ℵ~0~, so `StringMonoid` also contains an implementation to stream all possible strings.

=== Vector spaces

link:{ghm}abstractalgebra/VectorSpace.java[Vector spaces], which manage link:{ghm}abstractalgebra/Vector.java[`vectors`], are basically fixed sized sets of  link:{ghm}abstractalgebra/ScalarFieldElement.java[`scalars`], but combine that with several vector operations like cross and inner products.
