Math and physics related class.

== mihxil-math

The common dependency of the modules in the project. It provides the scaffolding for:

- abstract algebra's to ensure a common interface for basic operations
- an 'uncertain number' interface plus a SPI for formatting those

== mihxil-statistics

Implementations of `UncertainNumber`, based on calculating standard deviations on sets of incoming data, and using that as the uncertaintiy value.

Also, it includes some classes to keep track of 'sliding window' values of averages.

== mihxil-physics

This module envolves mostly `PhysicalNumber` and it's derivitates. A `PhysicalNumber` is a `UncertainNumber` but the uncertaintity is states (it is  `Measurement`), and knows how to propages those uncertainties when doing algebraic operations.

Also a `PhysicalNumber` can be assigned `Units`. This can be used for proper displaying the value, and for dimensional analysis.

== mihxil-algebra

This contains various implementations of the algebraic structure interfaces of `mihxil-math`. Like `RationalNumber` (modelling of rational numbers â„š), and the rotation group SO(3).
