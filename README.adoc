Math and physics related classes. This is a hobby project which grew from the classes in 'mihxil-statistics' which are actually used.

== mihxil-math

The common dependency of the modules in the project. It provides the scaffolding for:

- abstract algebra's to ensure a common interface for basic operations
- an 'uncertain number' interface plus a SPI for formatting those

=== Abstract Algebras

The idea is that every 'abstract algebra' consists of the implementation of two interfaces.

- One of the extensions of `org.meeuw.math.abstractalgebra.AlgebraicElement` defines the properties of all elements of the algebra. It also should implement the actual operations like multiplication and addition.

- One of the corresponding extensions of `org.meeuw.math.abstractalgebra.AlgebraicStructure`, e.g. `org.meeuw.math.abstractalgebra.Field`.

==== Algebraic elements

For example it may be `org.meeuw.math.abstractalgebra.FieldElement` the have  addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

==== Algebraic structure

Every algebraic element object has a reference to (the same)  instance of this structure. The structure itself defines e.g. the 'cardinality'. If the cardinality is 'countable', the structure can also implement `org.meeuw.math.abstractalgebra.Streamable` to actually produce all possible elements.

The algebraic structure will also contain methods to obtain 'special elements' like the identity elements for multiplication and addition ('one' and 'zero')


== mihxil-statistics

Implementations of `UncertainDouble`, based on calculating standard deviations on sets of incoming data, and using that as the uncertainty value.

Also, it includes some classes to keep track of 'sliding window' values of averages.

== mihxil-physics

This module envolves mostly around `PhysicalNumber` and its derivitates. A `PhysicalNumber` is a `UncertainDouble` but the uncertainty is stated (it is  `Measurement`), and knows how to propagate those uncertainties when doing algebraic operations.

Also a `PhysicalNumber` can be assigned `Units`. This can be used for proper displaying the value, and for dimensional analysis.

== mihxil-algebra

This contains various implementations of the algebraic structure interfaces of `mihxil-math`. Like `RationalNumber` (modelling of rational numbers â„š), and the rotation group SO(3).
