This collects some utility related to time (actually to Durations and Instants). The main purpose is to provide a way to represent uncertain values of time, but it also provides some utilities for working with `Clock`.

== Clocks

Because some uncertain values may be related to event rates, you may also need some things related to clocks. Especially, in test cases.

=== `TestClock`

A clock which must be manually 'ticked'. This  is mainly useful for testing purposes.

=== `UniqueClock`

A clock for which each call is guaranteed to result an Instant strictly after all previous calls. This can be used in tests, but also in production code, for example to ensure that events are always uniquely ordered.
